## What is DDSP?

Differentiable programming is a technique whereby a program can be
differentiated with respect to its inputs, permitting the computation of the
sensitivity of the program's outputs to changes in its inputs.
Partial derivatives of a program can be found analytically via
[automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation)
and, coupled with an appropriate loss function, used to perform gradient
descent.
Differentiable programming has consequently become a key tool in solving machine
learning problems.

**Differentiable digital signal processing**
([DDSP](https://intro2ddsp.github.io/background/what-is-ddsp.html)) is the
specific application of differentiable programming to audio tasks.
DDSP has emerged as a key component in machine learning approaches to
problems such as source separation, timbre transfer, parameter estimation, etc.
DDSP is reliant on a programming language with a supporting framework for
automatic differentiation.

## DDSP in Faust

> Trigger warning: some mild-to-moderate calculus will follow

To write automatically differentiable code we need analytic expressions for the
derivatives of the primitive operations in our program.

### A Differentiable Primitive

Let's consider the example of the addition primitive; in Faust one can write:

```faust
process = +;
```

which yields the block diagram:

![](./images/add.svg)

So, the output signal, the result of Faust's `process`, which we'll call $y$, is
the sum of two input signals, $u$ and $v$:

$$
y = u + v.
$$

Note that the addition primitive doesn't *know* anything about its arguments,
their origin, provenance, etc., it just consumes them and returns their sum.
In Faust's *algebra*, the addition of two signals (and just about *everything*
in Faust is a signal) is well-defined, and that's that.
This idea will be important later.

Now, say $y$ is dependent on some variable $x$, and we wish to know how
sensitive $y$ is to changes in $x$, then we should differentiate $y$ with
respect to $x$:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}\left(u + v\right) = \frac{du}{dx} + \frac{dv}{dx}.
$$

It happens that the derivative of an addition is also an addition, except this
time an addition of the derivatives of the arguments with respect to the
variable of interest.

In Faust, we could express this fact as follows:

```faust
process = +,+;
```

![](./images/dualadd.svg)

If we did, we'd be describing, in parallel, $y$ and $\frac{dy}{dx}$, which we
could write as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle y, \frac{dy}{dx} \rangle
&= \langle u, \frac{du}{dx} \rangle + \langle v, \frac{dv}{dx} \rangle \\
&= \langle u + v, \frac{du}{dx} + \frac{dv}{dx} \rangle.
\end{align*}
$$

This is a [*dual number*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number)
representation, or more accurately, since we're working with Faust, a *dual
signal* representation.
Being able to pass around our algorithm and its derivative in parallel, as dual
signals, is pretty handy, as we'll see later.
Anyway, what we've just defined is a *differentiable addition primitive*.

### But where exactly is the derivative?

Just as the addition primitive has no knowledge of its input signals, nor does
its differentiable counterpart.
The differentiable primitive promises the following: "give me $u$ and $v$, and
$\frac{du}{dx}$ and $\frac{dv}{dx}$ in that order, and I'll give you $y$ and
$\frac{dy}{dx}$".
So let's do just that.
For $u$ we'll use an arbitrary input signal, which we can represent with a wire,
`_`.
$x$ is the variable of interest; Faust's analogy to a variable is a slider[^1];
we'll create one and assign it to $v$.
$u$ and $x$ have no direct relationship, so $\frac{du}{dx}$ is $0$.
$v$ *is* $x$, so $\frac{dv}{dx}$ is $1$.

[^1]: This serves well enough for the example at hand, but in practice &mdash;
in a machine learning implementation &mdash; a *learnable parameter* is more
like a bargraph. We'll get to that [later](#gradient-descent).

```faust
x = hslider("x", 0, -1, 1, .1);
u = _;
v = x;
dudx = 0;
dvdx = 1;
process = u,v,dudx,dvdx : +,+;
```

![](./images/dc1.svg)

The first output of this program is the result of an expression describing an
input signal with a DC offset $x$ applied;
the second output is the derivative of that expression, a constant signal of
value $1$.
So far so good, but it's not very *automatic*.

### More Differentiable Primitives

We can generalise things a bit by defining a *differentiable input*[^2] and a
*differentiable slider*:

[^2]: An input isn't strictly a Faust primitive.
In fact, syntactically, what we're calling an *input* here is indistinguishable
from Faust's identity function, or *wire* (`_`), the derivative of which is also
a wire.
We need a distinct expression, however, for an arbitrary signal &mdash; mic
input, a soundfile, etc. &mdash; we know to be entering our program *from
outside*, as it were, and for which we have, in principle, no analytic
description.

```faust
diffInput = _,0;
diffSlider = hslider("x", 0, -1, 1, .1),1;
```

Simply applying the differentiable addition primitive to these new primitives
isn't going to work because inputs to the adder won't arrive in the correct
order;
we can fix this with a bit of routing however:

```faust
diffAdd = route(4,4,(1,1),(2,3),(3,2),(4,4)) : +,+;
```

Now we can write:

```faust
process = diffInput,diffSlider : diffAdd;
```

![](./images/dc2.svg)

The outputs of our program are the same as before, but we've computed the
derivative *automatically* &mdash; to be precise, we've implemented *forward
mode automatic differentiation*.
Now we have the makings of a modular approach to automatic differentiation based
on differentiable primitives and dual signals.

### Multivariate Problems

The above works fine for a single variable, but what if our program has more
than one variable?
Consider the following non-differentiable example featuring a gain control and
a DC offset:

```faust
x1 = hslider("gain", .5, 0, 1, .1);
x2 = hslider("dc", 0, -1, 1, .1);
process = _,x1 : *,x2 : +;
```

![](./images/gaindc1.svg)

We can write this as:

$$
y = uv + w, \quad v = x_1, \quad w = x_2.
$$

$u$ will again be an arbitrary input signal, for which we have no analytic
expression.

Now, rather than being a lone ordinary derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$, the
derivative of $y$ &mdash; $y'$ &mdash; is a matrix of *partial derivatives*:

$$
y' = \frac{\partial y}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
= \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_2}\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Our algorithm takes two parameter inputs, and produces one output signal, so the
resulting *Jacobian* matrix is of dimension $2 \times 1$.

Returning to dual number representation and applying the chain and product rules
of differentiation, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle y,y' \rangle &=
\langle u,u' \rangle \langle v,v' \rangle + \langle w,w' \rangle \\
&= \langle uv,u'v + v'u \rangle + \langle w,w' \rangle \\
&= \langle uv + w,u'v + v'u + w'\rangle,
\end{align*}
$$

To implement the above in Faust, let's define some multivariate differentiable
primitives:

```faust
diffInput(nvars) = _,par(i,nvars,0);

diffSlider(nvars,I,init,lo,hi,step) = hslider("x%I",init,lo,hi,step),par(i,nvars,i==I-1);

diffAdd(nvars) = route(nIN,nOUT,
        (u,1),(v,2), // u + v
        par(i,nvars,
            (u+i+1,dx),(v+i+1,dx+1) // du/dx_i + dv/dx_i
            with {
                dx = 2*i+3; // Start of derivatives wrt ith var
            }
        )
    ) with {
        nIN = 2+2*nvars;
        nOUT = nIN;
        u = 1;
        v = u+nvars+1;
    } : +,par(i, nvars, +);

diffMul(nvars) = route(nIN,nOUT,
        (u,1),(v,2), // u * v
        par(i,nvars,
            (u,dx),(dvdx,dx+1),   // u * dv/dx_i
            (dudx,dx+2),(v,dx+3)  // du/dx_i * v
            with {
                dx = 4*i+3; // Start of derivatives wrt ith var
                dudx = u+i+1;
                dvdx = v+i+1;
            }
        )
    ) with {
        nIN = 2+2*nvars;
        nOUT = 2+4*nvars;
        u = 1;
        v = u+nvars+1;
    } : *,par(i, nvars, *,* : +);
```

The routing for `diffAdd` and `diffMul` is a bit more involved, but the same
principle applies as for the univariate differentiable addition primitive.
Our dual signal representation now consists, for each primitive, of the
undifferentiated primitive, and, in parallel, `nvars` partial derivatives, each
with respect to the $i^\text{th}$ variable of interest.
Accordingly, the differentiable slider now needs to know which value of $i$ to
take to ensure that the appropriate combination of partial derivatives can be
generated.

Armed with the above we can write the differentiable equivalent of our gain+DC
example:

```faust
NVARS = 2;
x1 = diffSlider(NVARS,1,.5,0,1,.1);
x2 = diffSlider(NVARS,2,0,-1,1,.1);
process = diffInput(NVARS),x1 : diffMul(NVARS),x2 : diffAdd(NVARS);
```

### Estimating Hidden Parameters

Assigning the above algorithm to a variable `estimate`, we can compare its
first output, $y$, with target output, $\hat{y}$, produced by a `groundTruth`
algorithm with hard-coded gain and DC values.
We'll use Faust's default sine wave oscillator as input to both algorithms,
and, to perform the comparison, we'll use a time-domain L1-norm loss function:

$$
\mathcal{L}(y,\hat{y}) = ||y-\hat{y}||
$$

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib"); // For os.osc, si.bus, etc.
process = os.osc(440.) <: groundTruth,estimate : loss,si.bus(NVARS)
with {
    groundTruth = _,.5 : *,-.5 : +;

    NVARS = 2;
    x1 = diffSlider(NVARS,1,1,0,1,.1);
    x2 = diffSlider(NVARS,2,0,-1,1,.1);
    estimate = diffInput(NVARS),x1 : diffMul(NVARS),x2 : diffAdd(NVARS);

    loss = ro.cross(2) : - : abs <: attach(hbargraph("loss",0,2));
};
```

reported by the loss function, thus discovering the "hidden" parameters of the
ground truth.

> TODO: loss gif

### Gradient Descent

So far we haven't made use of our Faust program's partial derivatives.
Our next step is to automate parameter estimation by incorporating these
derivatives into a gradient descent algorithm.

Gradients are found as the derivative of the loss function with respect to
$\mathbf{x}$ at time $t$.
To get $\mathbf{x}_{t+1}$, we scale the gradients by a *learning rate*,
$\alpha$, and subtract the result from $\mathbf{x}_t$.
For our L1-norm loss function that looks like this:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{x}_{t+1} &= \mathbf{x}_t - \alpha\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_t} \\
&= \mathbf{x}_t - \alpha\frac{\partial y}{\partial \mathbf{x}_t}\frac{y-\hat{y}}{|y-\hat{y}|}.
\end{align*}
$$

In Faust, we can't programmatically update the value of a slider.[^3]
What we ought to do at this point, to automate the estimation of parameter
values, is invert our approach; we'll use sliders for our "hidden" parameters,
and define a differentiable variable to represent their "learnable"
counterparts:

[^3]: Actually, programmatic parameter updates _are_ possible via
[Widget Modulation](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/syntax/#widget-modulation),
but changes aren't reflected in the UI.
In the interests of keeping things intuitive and visually illustrative, we won't
use widget modulation here.

```faust
diffVar(nvars,I,graph) = -~_ <: attach(graph),par(i,nvars,i+1==I);
```

`diffVar` handles the subtraction of the scaled gradient, and we can pass it a
bargraph to display the current parameter value.

To supply gradients to the learnable parameters the program has to be set up
as a rather grand recursion:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");

process = os.osc(440.) 
    : hgroup("DDSP",(route(1+NVARS,2+NVARS,(1+NVARS,1),(1+NVARS,2),par(i,NVARS,(i+1,i+3))) 
        : vgroup("[0]Parameters",groundTruth,learnable)
        : route(2+NVARS,4+NVARS,(1,1),(2,2),(1,3),(2,4),par(i,NVARS,(i+3,i+5))) 
        : vgroup("[1]Loss & Gradients",loss,gradients)
    )) ~ (!,si.bus(NVARS))
with {
    groundTruth = vgroup("Hidden", 
        _,hslider("[0]gain",.5,0,1,.1) : *,hslider("[1]DC",-.5,-1,1,.1) : +
    );

    NVARS = 2;

    x1 = diffVar(NVARS,1,hbargraph("[0]gain", 0, 1));
    x2 = diffVar(NVARS,2,hbargraph("[1]DC", -1, 1));
    learnable = vgroup("Learned", diffInput(NVARS),x1,_ : diffMul(NVARS),x2 : diffAdd(NVARS));

    loss = ro.cross(2) : - : abs <: attach(hbargraph("[1]loss",0.,2));
    alpha = hslider("[0]Learning rate [scale:log]", 1e-4, 1e-6, 1e-1, 1e-6);
    gradients = (ro.cross(2): -),si.bus(NVARS)
        : route(NVARS+1,2*NVARS+1,(1,1),par(i,NVARS,(1,i*2+3),(i+2,2*i+2)))
        : (abs,1e-10 : max),par(i,NVARS, *)
        : route(NVARS+1,NVARS*2,par(i,NVARS,(1,2*i+2),(i+2,2*i+1)))
        : par(i,NVARS, /,alpha : * <: attach(hbargraph("gradient %i",-1e-2,1e-2)));
};
```

in the web IDE, we see the learned gain and DC values leap (more or less eagerly
depending on the learning rate) to meet the hidden values.

Note that we actually needn't compute the loss function, unless we wanted to
use some low threshold on $\mathcal{L}$ to halt the learning process.
Also, we're not producing any true audio output,[^4] though we could easily
route the first signal produced by the learnable algorithm to output by
modifying the first `route()` instance in `vgroup("DDSP",...)`.

[^4]: We _hear_ the signal produced by the loss function, however;
there's plenty of fun to be had (see
[examples/broken-osc.dsp](./examples/broken-osc.dsp) for example) in sonifying
the byproducts of the learning process.

The example we've just considered is a pretty basic one, and if the inputs to
`groundTruth` and `learnable` were out of phase by, say, 25 samples, it
would be a lot harder to minimise the loss function.
To work around this we might take time-domain loss over windowed chunks of
input, or compute phase-invariant loss in the frequency domain.

## The `diff` Library

To include the `diff` library, use Faust's `library` expression:

```faust
df = library("/path/to/diff.lib");
```

The library defines a selection of differentiable primitives and helper
functions for describing differentiable Faust programs.

`diff` uses Faust's pattern matching feature where possible.

### The Autodiff Environment

To avoid having to pass the number of differentiable parameters to each
primitive, differentiable primitives are defined within an `environment`
expression named `df.env`.
Begin by defining parameters with `df.vars` and then call `df.env`, passing
in the parameters as an argument, e.g.:

```faust
df = library("diff.lib");
...
vars = df.vars((x1,x2))
with {
    x1 = -~_ <: attach(hbargraph("x1",0,1));
    x2 = -~_ <: attach(hbargraph("x2",0,1));
};

d = df.env(vars);
```

Having defined a differentiable environment in this way, primitives can be
called as follows, and the appropriate number of partial derivatives will be
calculated:

```faust
process = d.diff(+);
```

Additionally, parameters themselves can be accessed with `vars.var(n)`, where
`n` is the parameter index, starting from 1:

```faust
df = library("diff.lib");

vars = df.vars((gain))
with {
    gain = -~_ <: attach(hbargraph("gain",0,1));
};

d = df.env(vars);

process = d.input,vars.var(1) : d.diff(*);
```

The number of parameters can be accessed with `vars.N`:

```faust
...
learnable = d.input,si.bus(vars.N) // A differentiable input, N gradients
...
```

### Differentiable Primitives

For the examples for the primitives that follow, assume the following
boilerplate:

```faust
df = library("diff.lib");
vars = df.vars((x1,x2)) with { x1 = -~_; x2 = -~_; };
d = df.env(vars);
```

#### Number Primitive

$$

- Output: one dual signal consisting of the constant signal and `vars.N` partial
  derivatives, which all equal $0$.

```faust
ma = library("maths.lib");
process = d.diff(2*ma.PI);
```

![](./images/diffnum.svg)

diff(_)
```

$$

- Output: one dual signal consisting of the sum and `vars.N` partial derivatives

```faust
process = d.diff(+);
```

![](./images/diffadd.svg)

#### Subtract Primitive

diff(-)
```

  derivatives

process = d.diff(-);
```

![](./images/diffsub.svg)

  derivatives

```

$$

- Input: two dual signals
- Output: one dual signal consisting of the quotient and `vars.N` partial
  derivatives

NB. To prevent division by zero in the partial derivatives, `diff(/)`
uses whichever is the largest of $v^2$ and $1\times10^{-10}$.

```faust
process = d.diff(/);
```

![](./images/diffdiv.svg)

#### Power primitive

```faust
diff(^)
```

$$
\langle u,u' \rangle^{\langle v,v' \rangle} =
\langle u^v, u^{v-1}(vu' + uv'\ln(u)) \rangle
$$

- Input: two dual signals
- Output: one dual signal consisting of the first input signal raised to the
  power of the second, and `vars.N` partial derivatives.

```faust
process = d.diff(^);
```

![](./images/diffpow.svg)

#### `int` Primitive

```faust
diff(int)
```

$$
\text{int}\left(\langle u, u'\rangle\right) = \langle\text{int}(u), \partial \rangle, \quad
\partial = \begin{cases}
u', &\sin(\pi u) = 0, u~\text{increasing} \\
-u', &\sin(\pi u) = 0, u~\text{decreasing} \\
0, &\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

- Input: one dual signal
- Output: one dual signal consisting of the integer cast and `vars.N` partial
  derivatives

NB. `int` is a discontinuous function, and its derivative is impulse-like at
integer values of $u$, i.e. at $\sin(\pi u) = 0$; impulses are positive for
increasing $u$, negative for decreasing.[^5]

[^5]: Yes, this is a bit of an abomination, mathematically-speaking.

process = d.diff(int);
```

![](./images/diffint.svg)

```

![](./images/diffmem.svg)

#### `@` Primitive

diff(@)
```

$$
\langle u, u' \rangle[n-\langle v, v' \rangle] = \langle u[n-v], u'[n-v] - v'(u[n-v])'_n \rangle
$$

- Input: two dual signals
- Output: one dual signal consisting of the first input signal delayed by the
  second, and `vars.N` partial derivatives of the delay expression

NB. the general time-domain expression for the derivative of a delay features
a component which is a derivative with respect to (discrete) time:
$(u[n-v])'_n$.
This component is computed asymmetrically in time, so `diff(@)` is of
limited use for time-variant $v$.
It appears to behave well enough for fixed $v$.

```

![](./images/diffdel.svg)

$$

- Input: one dual signal
- Output: one dual signal consisting of the tangent of the input and `vars.N`
  partial derivatives

NB. To prevent division by zero in the partial derivatives, `diff(tan,vars.N)`
uses whichever is the largest of $\cos^2(u)$ and $1\times10^{-10}$.

```faust
process = d.diff(tan);
```

![](./images/difftan.svg)

#### `asin` Primitive

```faust
diff(asin)
```

$$
\arcsin(\langle u, u'\rangle) = \langle\arcsin(u), \frac{u'}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}\rangle
$$

- Input: one dual signal
- Output: one dual signal consisting of the arcsine of the input and `vars.N`
  partial derivatives

NB. To prevent division by zero in the partial derivatives, `diff(asin,vars.N)`

![](./images/diffasin.svg)

```faust
process = d.diff(acos);
```

![](./images/diffacos.svg)

d =
\begin{cases}
u' & \text{if } u < v \\

  partial derivatives

process = d.diff(min);
```

![](./images/diffmin.svg)

#### `max` Primitive

![](./images/diffceil.svg)

**Remainder of the primitives are defined as the following:**

$$
f(\langle u, u' \rangle) = \langle f(u), 0 \rangle
$$

This is due to the fact that these primitives (especially bitwise primitives and such) are not well-defined in autodiff. The developers should be
aware that the current system assumes that certain discontinuous functions' derivatives are 0, which may not be appropriate in all cases.

### Helper Functions

#### Input Primitive

```faust

```

$$
u \rightarrow \langle u,u' \rangle = \langle u,0 \rangle
$$

```faust
process = d.input;
```

#### Differentiable Recursive Composition

```faust
rec(f~g,ngrads)
```

A utility for supporting the creation of differentiable recursive circuits.
Facilitates the passing of gradients into the body of the recursion.

- Inputs:
  - `f`: A differentiable expression taking two dual signals as input and
    producing one dual signal as output.
  - `g`: A differentiable expression taking one dual signal as input and
    producing one dual signal as output.
  - `ngrads`: The number of differentiable variables in `g`, i.e. the number
    of gradients to be passed into the body of the recursion.
- Outputs: One dual signal; the result of the recursion.

E.g. a differentiable 1-pole filter with one parameter, the coefficient of the
feedback component:

```faust
process = gradient,d.input : df.rec(f~g,1)
with {
    vars = df.vars((a)) with { a = -~_; };
    d = df.env(vars);
    f = d.diff(+);
    g = d.diff(_),vars.var(1) : d.diff(*);
    gradient = _;
};
```

#### Differentiable Phasor

```faust
phasor(f0)
```

#### Differentiable Oscillator

```faust
osc(f0)
```

#### Differentiable `sum` iteration
A utility function used to iterate `N` times through a summation of dual signals.

```faust
sumall(N)
```
### Machine Learning
#### Parameter Estimation 
##### Backpropagation circuit
This backpropagation circuit is exclusively for _parameter estimation_ and it functions via the creation of gradients and a loss function in order to guide the `learnable` parameter to the `groundTruth`. The available loss functions can be found below.

```faust
backprop(groundTruth, learnable, lossFunction)
```

NB. this is defined _outside_ of the autodiff environment, e.g.:

```faust
df = library("diff.lib");
...
process = df.backprop(groundTruth, learnable, lossFunction);
```
#### Core Machine Learning (ML) Circuits
##### Optimizers
Optimizers are algorithms or methods used in ML to adjust the learning rate / gradients of a model in order to minimize the loss function. 

###### Momentum-based optimizers
One can easily introduce the concept of momentum into their optimizer by simply modifying their variables in the diff environment to the following:

```faust
df = library("diff.lib");
vars = df.vars((x1,x2))
with {
    x1 = _ : +~(_ : *(momentum)) : -~_ <: attach(hbargraph("x1",0,1));
    x2 = _ : +~(_ : *(momentum)) : -~_<: attach(hbargraph("x2",0,1));
    momentum = 0.9;
};
```

We suggest the use of this only when using SGD as the optimizer.

###### SGD Optimizer
This is a regular stochastic gradient descent optimizer which does not account for an adaptive learning rate. This performs pure gradient descent.

```faust
optimizers.SGD(learningRate)
```

###### Adam Optimizer
This is an optimizer, implemented as per the original Adam paper[^6].

```faust
optimizers.Adam(learningRate, beta1, beta2)
```

We recommend beta1 and beta2 to be 0.9 and 0.999; similar to Kera's recommendations.

###### RMSProp Optimizer
This is an optimizer, implemented as per the original RMSProp presentation[^7].

```faust
optimizers.RMSProp(learningRate, rho)
```
We recommend rho to be 0.9; similar to Kera's recommendations.

An implementation of any of the above optimizers can be seen below:

```faust
df.backprop(truth,learnable,d.learnMAE(1<<5,d.optimizers.SGD(1e-3)))
```

##### Learning Rate Scheduler
This scheduler decays the learnable rate by $exp(delta)$ every $epoch$ iterations.

- Input: learning_rate, epoch, delta
- Output: resulting learning_rate

```faust
learning_rate : learning_rate_scheduler(epoch, delta)
```

##### Loss Functions

This loss function accepts a `windowSize` parameter that allows Faust to record the (ba.)slidingMean of the last `windowSize` inputs to the loss function. This allows the input to be averaged over a small period of time and avoid random spikes of inputs or inconsistencies in signals. This loss function also calculates the loss as well the gradients to guide the `learnable` parameter to the required `truth` parameter.

Furthermore, `optimizer` can be substituted with a scheduler as listed below. 

###### L1 time-domain (MAE)

```faust
learnMAE(windowSize, optimizer)
```

- Input: windowSize, optimizer
- Output: loss, a gradient per parameter defined in the environment

Mathematically, this loss function is defined as:

$$
L = |y - \hat{y}|
$$

while gradients are defined as:

$$
G = \frac{y - \hat{y}}{|y - \hat{y}|} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
$$

\frac{1}{2}(y - \hat{y})^2 & \text{for } |y - \hat{y}| \le \delta, \\ 
\delta \cdot \left(|y - \hat{y}| - \frac{1}{2}\delta\right) & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

while, gradients are defined in autodiff as:

$$

\begin{cases} 
(y - \hat{y})^2 \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} & \text{for } |y - \hat{y}| \le \delta, \\ 
\delta \cdot \left(\frac{y - \hat{y}}{|y - \hat{y}|}\right) \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

where $y$ is your predicted output signal, while $\hat{y}$ is your target signal; a suggested $\delta$ is 1.0.

###### Linear frequency-domain
NB. This loss function converges to the global minimum for the range $[140, 1350]$ Hz. This was tested with `os.osc` and `os.square` waveform. A recurring issue one can notice is that the loss landscape is so varied that it fails to learn outside this range and gets stuck at local minima. A possible solution to this issue is to introduce a better optimizer (rather than SGD), or a learning rate scheduler to solve such an issue. We report that RMSProp seems to break out of the minimum at some threshold and it seems to train well until another minimum. As a result, we suspect that the loss landscape is a series of plateaus and hence, a suitable learning rate scheduler (such as, an oscillating learning rate) and a good optimizer is required to solve this problem.

```faust
learnLinearFreq(windowSize, optimizer)
```

## Neural Networks
The core component of neural networks is a neuron. We introduce the concept of a neuron in this library.

The task of parameter estimation can lead to overfitting to a specific value. As a result, there is a need to create a more generalized model that can accurately predict / classify things in the audio-domain. The issue is the creation of a fully functioning ML model that can create accurate weights and biases to deal with tasks such as classification, regression and more. This can also be extended to more complex models such as the creation of generative models, such as autoencoders. 

### A functioning neuron
We introduce the concept of a single functioning neuron in example [single_neuron.dsp](./examples/experiments/single_neuron.dsp). This allows us to take a single hidden layer between the input and the output. This is a classification example to illustrate how Faust can create non-linear neural structures. 

The structure of a single neuron looks something like so: 

![](./images/single_neuron.svg)

In Faust, this looks something like this, along with the backpropagation algorithm:

![](./images/example-neuron.svg)

So, what exactly happens in a neuron? Assume we use a sigmoid function as a non-linear activation function in this example.
The hidden layer calculates the following:

$$
a_{1} = w1 \cdot x1 
$$

$$
y = \sigma(a_{1})
$$

This example utilizes the MAE / L1-norm loss function. The loss is represented as:

$$
L = |y - \hat{y}|
$$

This seems simple enough, but for defining the gradients, we need to define:

$$
G_{i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{i}}
$$

We assume a symbolic approach to applying chain rule. We explain why in later sections of this documentation. These gradients need to be further simplified for our usage via chain rule, although traditional autodiff does not simplify like this:

$$
G_{i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{i}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial a_{1}} \cdot \frac{\partial a_{1}}{\partial w_{i}} \\
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = \frac{y - \hat{y}}{|y - \hat{y}|} \\
$$

$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial a_{1}} = \frac{\partial (\sigma(a_{1}))}{\partial a_{1}} = \sigma(a_{1}) \cdot (1 - \sigma(a_{1})) \\
$$

$$ 
\frac{\partial a_{1}}{\partial w_{i}} = x_{i} \\
$$

This is pretty complex. Imagine the complexity for more deeper layers! You would have chains of chains of chains ... rules. As a result, there is a definite need for to create generalized routing for such gradients.

NB. This example is more indicative of a symbolic differentiation approach; but we will continue to talk about automatic differentiation throughout the next section.

## Faust Neural Network Blocks
In Faust, neural network blocks are defined as different types of layers, such as fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent, commonly used in machine learning. We use the basic concept of a neuron and attempt to create more generalized blocks (such as fully connected layers) that operate on the core concept of how backpropagation would exist in a language such as Faust.

At present, only forward mode automatic differentiation is implemented in a generalisable way in Faust. In forward mode, gradients are computed during N forward passes of the chain rule (where N is the number of input variables), then propagated back to the inputs.

### Fully Connected (FC) Layer
A fully connected layer, also known as a dense layer, is a fundamental component of neural networks where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and subsequent layers. This layer is responsible for learning complex representations of data by performing a weighted sum of inputs, followed by the application of an activation function.

#### Example: One FC
Let's begin with the math involved with the forward-pass and the backward-pass in a fully connected layer (FCL). Let's first begin with a simple example of an output FC, consisting of one neuron only.

![](./images/diff-singlefc.svg)

This example involves 7 signals passing through the neuron (3 weights, 1 bias, 3 inputs). We will denote weights as $w$, biases as $b$ and inputs as $x$.

In this example, let us assume the incoming signals to be $w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}, b, x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$. The neuron appropriately routes these parameters for backpropagation. As stated earlier, gradients are applied here:

```faust
weights(n, learningRate) = par(i, n, _ : *(learningRate) : -~_ <: attach(hbargraph("weight%i", -1, 1)));
bias(learningRate) = _ : *(learningRate) : -~_ <: attach(hbargraph("bias", -1, 1));
```

We actively allow for the calculation of the $a_{1}$ as stated in [a functioning neuron](#a-functioning-neuron), and further calculate $y$ via an appropriate activation function (via autodiff). 

Since this example exhibits only one fully connected layer (FCL), this means that the one FCL acts as the output layer. As a result, the output from the FCL must be fed to the loss function to calculate the losses and its derivatives. At the moment, the loss functions are implemented strictly for the purpose of classification with respect to a particular value. This can be extended to regression to a particular extent, which has not been experimented yet. 

Since we deal with an output FCL only, we would need to calculate the losses which is done via the L1 loss function. The loss function continues autodiff and hence, produces a list of derivatives of $L$ with respect to the parameters stated above. We will cover the implementation of these loss functions in the next section.

Using the loss function (and autodiff), we produce the following from the FCL:

$$
{ L, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{2}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{3}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{3}} }
$$

Mathematically speaking, we can expect $2N+2$ signals as a output from an FCL, assuming $N$ inputs. Since this example is pretty simple, we can simply backpropagate the gradients of $w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}, b$ with respect to L to the FCL. Note that users using this library must know the number of weights and biases a single FC takes in. We'll cover this in the next few sections.

#### Example: Two+ FCs

Let's take a more complex example -- this example deals with the creation of a binary classifier (0 and 1 only). While this example focuses on binary classification, the underlying principles can be extended to regression tasks. For instance, a binary classifier could be adapted to predict whether an input waveform is sinusoidal or square (view the working of the same here -- [fc-3.dsp](./examples/experiments/fc-3.dsp)). This will help us understand the core workings of the backpropagation algorithm in this library. We will utilize a neural network composed of three FCLs here. The first layer contains 2 neurons, the second layer contains 3 neuron and the final layer is the output layer, containing 1 neuron. From this diagram, let us assume the first FCL to be $FC_{1}$, the second FCL to be $FC_{2}$ and the third FCL to be $FC_{3}$. The inputs for $FC_{1}$ are $x_{1}$ only. 

![](./images/diff-threelayerfc.svg)

The other input signals to the FCL are the gradients of the weights and biases to each neuron. $FC_{1}$ contains 2 neurons. From each neuron, we expect the following -- since this is NOT the final layer, we do not calculate the loss yet. As a result, here is what we expect from each neuron, assuming it has one input $x_{1}$ and the weights are $w_{1}$ and bias is $b$:

$$
{ y, \frac{\partial y}{\partial w_{1}}, \frac{\partial y}{\partial b}, \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_{1}} }
$$

Now, since we have multiple neurons in this FC, we route all the outputs (i.e. $y$) to the top of the circuit and hence, we can appropriately use the outputs to act as the input to the next FC. Users need to note that since this layer has 2 neurons, it will have 2 outputs (1 from each). As a result, the next FC (i.e. $FC_{2}$) will need to take in 2 inputs.

What are we missing here to make these gradients appropriate for backpropagation? We're missing $\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}$ for each neuron. Since each neuron outputs a $y$, we need a partial derivative of L with respect to y in order to obtain the correct gradients for backpropagation.

Let's move on to the second FCL $FC_{2}$. The outputs of $FC_{1}$ i.e. $y1, y2$ are now the inputs to this connected layer. What now? The same operation occurs and we attempt to produce the gradients (via end-to-end autodiff). Assume the inputs to this $FC_{2}$ to be now $x_{1}', x_{2}'$ instead of $y1, y2$. This $FC_{2}$ finally produces the following, assuming $w_{1}', w_{2}', b' ...$ to be the weights and biases of this layer (3 $y$ due to 3 neurons):

$$
{ y1, y2, y3, \frac{\partial y1}{\partial w_{1}'}, \frac{\partial y1}{\partial w_{2}'}, \frac{\partial y1}{\partial b'}, \frac{\partial y1}{\partial x_{1}'}, \frac{\partial y1}{\partial x_{2}'} ... } 
$$

The same pattern is observed for $y2$ and $y3$. The same occurs for $FC_{3}$. $FC_{2}$ had 3 neurons -- 3 outputs and hence, $FC_{3}$ must have 3 inputs. $FC_{3}$ must produce 1 output only (since we assumed that this is a classification task) and hence, we notice that it must have 1 neuron only. It produces the following, assuming $w_{1}'', w_{2}'', w_{3}'', b''$ to be the weights and biases of this layer.

$$
{ L, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1}''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{2}''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{3}''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial b''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{3}''} }
$$

Here, $x_{1}''$, $x_{2}''$, $x_{3}''$ are the inputs to $FC_{3}$ or the outputs of $FC_{2}$ (i.e. $y1, y2, y3$).

Now, we need to appropriately modify the gradients that each neuron produced by $FC_{1}$ and $FC_{2}$. We do so by the simple chain rule. This is where we see a limitation of this specific algorithm. Chain rule, in this context, is a representation of symbolic differentation. 

We have $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}''}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{3}''}$ in hand. These are essentially $\frac{\partial L}{\partial y1}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial y2}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial y3}$. 


We now use the chain rule to produce the following gradients:

$$
{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{1}'}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{2}'}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial b'}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}'}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}'}, ... } 
$$

As a result, we've achieved the gradients for the weights and biases for each neuron in $FC_{2}$. We can now average (we explain why in the next paragraph) the input gradients from $FC_{2}$ to get the appropriate gradients for $FC_{1}$. This system proves that backpropagation by itself is a complex algorithm that needs to be finetuned for previous layers. Regardless, we have the following gradients left:

$$
{ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}} }
$$

These are just duplicates from each neuron. Typically, in machine learning applications, gradients are aggregated by taking the mean -- however, there are multiple methods of aggregation; we will stick to averaging for now. As a result, we provide these gradients (in this case, 3 gradients) for previous layer's backprop.

#### Limitations of the backpropagation approach
As stated above, we need input gradients from a layer to be fed into the backpropagation algorithm for a previous layer. This is to ensure that we obtain appropriate gradients for backprop. Appropriate gradients, in this context, also means the derivative of $L$ with respect to all parameters of that neuron. 

Obviously, to do this, we implement the chain rule algorithm, by symbolically completing application of the chain rule as a
final step. This is a major limitation we noticed during development.

#### FCL Algorithm
This library is specifically designed for building generalized neural networks. Users must note the following while using this library:
- Be aware of the number of weights / biases that must enter a FC.
- Note how to create the backpropagation environment.

As a result, we define the following functions:

##### Forward Pass
The forward pass includes the conversion of a neuron's parameter $w$, $b$ and $x$ to $y$ via an activation function. This is done via the FC. This FC is just a collection of multiple neurons.

```faust
df.fc(N, n, activationFn, learning_rate)
```

Here, $N$ = number of neurons in the FC; $n$ = number of inputs to the FC.

##### Activation Functions and Loss
For the FC, we need to define the activation functions and losses. The losses would be a separate block which should be seen after the last FC layer. We need to use special activation functions and loss functions which you may call using the following:

```faust
df.activations.sigmoid
...

df.losses.L1(windowSize, y, N)
...
```

Here, $y$ refers to the target variable that are looking for; $N$ refers to the number of inputs to the **LAST** FC layer.


### Backpropagation
Let's first define how to create a backpropagation environment. Our backpropagation environment requires knowledge about the parameters of the entire neural network. 


```faust
b = df.backpropNN((1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1));
```

This is the backpropagation environment for the second example stated above. We define this environment by including the (number of neurons, number of inputs) from the last layer to the first layer. In this case, (1, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 1). 

To begin backpropagation itself, we ensure that it occurs in an end-to-end manner. With all signals as input, we use the following for backpropagation.

```faust
b.start(b.N - 1)
```

A demonstration of the backpropagation itself for a single FC can be seen here:

![](./images/diff-backpropFC.svg)

The internal workings of this involves using chain rule and routing mechanisms to appropriately route the gradients:

![](./images/diff-chainRule.svg)

This does backpropagation of the entire neural network -- but we internally do backpropagation layer by layer (i.e. FC by FC). It ignores the last layer, since the loss function automatically provides the correct gradients for backprop. The rest of the layers use this algorithm recursively.

#### Gradient Averaging 
Each neuron in an FC tends to produce a duplicate of the input gradients i.e. in this figure, each neuron produces input gradients (apart from the other 3 gradients):

![](./images/diff-gradAvg.svg)

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{2}}
$$

Three neurons do the above process. As stated in previous sections, machine learning engineers tend to aggregate these gradients by just averaging them out. We do the same -- but this process is hidden in the backpropagation environment.

```faust
df.gradAveraging(N, n)
```

Here, $N$ refers to the number of neurons in that FC, $n$ refers to the number of inputs in that FC.

### A Generalized Example
Let's take up the example in [fc.dsp](./examples/experiments/fc.dsp) and [fc-3.dsp](./examples/experiments/fc-3.dsp). The comments in this example are extensive and should guide you throughout the process.

This segment of code is extremely generalized and you may add more layers / more backpropagation environment elements as needed.

#### Final tips for creation of a neural network
- You must know that while defining a neural network, you must use `par(i, b.next_signals(N), _)` to allow the gradients from all previous layers to pass through the current FC layer. $N$ in this context refers to the number of previous FC layers that were defined. Refer to the example for more understanding.
- Note the number of weights and biases each FC should take in. The recursion should be crafted appropriately.

### Bridging to a realistic example
Using [fc-3.dsp](./examples/experiments/fc-3.dsp) as inspiration, we believe this example could serve as a foundation for generating a realistic dataset in another language, such as C++, and subsequently creating a functional neural network by integrating C++ with Faust. Additionally, this could be a stepping stone towards obtaining weights and biases and storing them in a file for offline inference.
